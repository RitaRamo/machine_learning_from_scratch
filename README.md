# Machine learning from scratch ðŸ¤–

The general idea of this repository is to practice, explain and, mostly, having fun using python to code machine learning (ML) algorithms from scratch. 

There are several ML tools that I use (and way more effeciently than my code), but sometimes is good to take a step back and refresh how it is implemented behind the hoods. 

This repository is meant for me to practice, but if somehow it helps others to understand more on ML, the better.
